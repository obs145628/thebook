Using gdb to debug assembly instructions:

- You can compile a .S file with -g flag, and use gdb like for a normal C file

- For file compiled without debug insrtructions, or to debug the actual real instructions, you can go the ASM mode:
(gdb) layout asm

- To go the next instruction, next won't work, use this command
(gdb) stepi

-  You can display all registers:
(gdb) info registers
Or only a few:
(gdb) info registers rax rbx

- Display memory: more infos at https://sourceware.org/gdb/current/onlinedocs/gdb/Memory.html
